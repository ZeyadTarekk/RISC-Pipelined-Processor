## About <a name = "about"></a>


- In this project, we apply a Harvard architecture with two memory units; Instructions‚Äô memory and Data memory.
- The processor in this project has a RISC-like instruction set architecture. There are eight 2-bytes general purpose registers [ R0 to R7]. These registers are separate from the program counter and the stack pointer registers.
- The program counter (PC) spans the instructions memory address space that has a total size of 2 Megabytes. Each memory address has a 16-bit width (i.e., is word addressable). The instructions memory starts with the interrupts area (the very first address space from [0 down to 25-1]), followed by the instructions area (starting from [25and down to 220]) as shown in Figure.1. By default, the PC is initialized with a value of (25) where the program code starts.
- The other memory unit is the data memory, which has a total size of 4 Kilobytes for its own, 16-bit in width (i.e., is word addressable). The processor can access both memory units at the same time without having a memory access hazard.
- The data memory starts with the data area (the very first address space and down), followed by the stack area (starting from [211‚àí1 and up]) as shown in Figure.1. By default, the stack pointer (SP) pointer points to the top of the stack (the next free address available in the stack), and is initialized by a value of (211-1).
- When an interrupt occurs, the processor finishes the currently fetched instructions (instructions that have already entered the pipeline), save the processor state (Flags), then the address of the next instruction (in PC) is saved on top of the stack, and PC is loaded from address 0 of the memory where the interrupt code resides.
- To return from an interrupt, an RTI instruction loads the PC from the top of stack, restores the processor state (Flags), and the flow of the program resumes from the instruction that was supposed to be fetched in-order before handling the interrupted instruction.
